# Real-Time Robot Arm Simulator

## Description:

This project aims to develop an open-source, real-time robot arm simulator inspired by the KUKA KR 700 PA palletizing robot. The primary focus is on educational purposes and performing simple industrial tasks, such as pick-and-place operations with a payload of approximately 0.5 kg. The robotic arm will be built using NEMA stepper motors, motor drivers, and an Atmega or STM controller. The simulator will be developed using Blender for 3D modeling, rigging, and simulation, along with Python or Rust scripting for communication and synchronization with the physical robotic arm.

The main goal of this project is to create a virtual representation of the robotic arm that accurately mirrors its real-world counterpart's behavior and allows users to visualize, interact with, and control the robotic arm through the simulator interface. This will provide a valuable open-source educational tool for understanding robotic systems, as well as a platform for testing and refining control algorithms before deploying them in real-world environments.

## The project will involve the following steps:

- *3D Modeling:* Create a detailed 3D model of the robotic arm and its components in Blender, inspired by the KUKA KR 700 PA palletizing robot, ensuring that the dimensions and characteristics accurately represent the real-world robot.

- *Rigging:* Rig the robot arm in Blender, creating a control system that corresponds to the joints and actuators of the real robot.

- *Scripting:* Develop scripts using Python or Rust within Blender to interface with the Atmega or STM controller, stepper motors, and motor drivers, enabling communication between the simulator and the physical robot.

- *Real-time Simulation:* Implement real-time simulation in Blender, using Python or Rust to synchronize the simulator's behavior with the real robot. This will involve continuously updating the simulator's position and orientation based on sensor data from the real robot.

- *User Interface:* Design a user interface within Blender that allows users to interact with and control the simulator, send commands to the physical robot, and visualize sensor data and system status.

- *Documentation and Tutorials:* Create comprehensive documentation and tutorials explaining the project's structure, components, and usage, as well as providing guidance for setting up the hardware and software required for the simulator.
