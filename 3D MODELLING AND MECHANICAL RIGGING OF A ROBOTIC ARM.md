• 3D-Modelling is the process of creating 3- dimensional representations of an

object or a surface via specialized software including Blender

<a name="br4"></a>**RIGGING AND CONSTRAINING**

• Rigging is the process of creating guides for movement in the 3D objects.• Constraints and limits ensure that the robot arm moves realistically.
